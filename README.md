# Stock-analysis

In this repository i am going to analysis all the different stocks and also create a dashboard using powerBI 

Stock market data is widely analyzed for educational, business and personal interests.

The data is the price history and trading volumes of the fifty stocks in the index NIFTY 50 from NSE (National Stock Exchange) India. All datasets are at a day-level with pricing and trading values split across .cvs files for each stock along with a metadata file with some macro-information about the stocks itself. 

```The data spans from 1st January, 2000 to 30th April, 2021.
```

In this analysis I am exploring the dataset related to the following:

```
1. COALINDIA: Coal India Limited (CIL) is an Indian government-owned coal mining and refining corporation, headquartered in Kolkata. 
2. HINDUUNILVR: It deal with different cosmatic products 50+ product 
3. NTPC: NTPC are setting up of power plants and power generation through its coal-based and gas-based power plants.

5. RELIANCE: The exploration and production of oil and gas to the manufacture of petroleum products, polyester products, polyester intermediates, plastics, polymer intermediates, chemicals, synthetic textiles and fabrics.
